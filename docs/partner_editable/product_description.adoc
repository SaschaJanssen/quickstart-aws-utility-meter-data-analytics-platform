{partner-product-name} Quick Start deploys a serverless architecture to ingest, store, and analyze utility meter data, available from the MDM systems. It creates an AWS Glue Workflow which consists of AWS Glue crawlers, jobs and data catalog, to convert the raw meter data (from MDM systems) into clean and partitioned data. This partitioned data is then consumed by Machine learning pipeline built using AWS Step function and Amazon Sagemaker, to create an ML model. This model is then used by another ML pipeline to batch process the meter data for providing energy usage forecast and usage anomaly detection.

This Quick Start also creates API endpoints, using Amazon API Gateway, to provide REST APIs which can be utilized to get information about the energy usage forecast, anomaly detection and meter outage information. A sample Jupyter notebook is also provided with this Quick Start, which can be used to do data science and data visualizations on the provided sample data set, or run adhoc queries on your own meter data set.
