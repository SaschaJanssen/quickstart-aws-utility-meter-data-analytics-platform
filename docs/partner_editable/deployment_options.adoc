// There are generally two deployment options. If additional are required, add them here

This Quick Start creates a serverless architecture in your AWS Account. As part of the Quick Start deployment, it creates a Redshift cluster, which is created in a private subnet within a VPC.

For deployment of the Redshift cluster, this Quick Start provides two deployment options:

* *Deploy {partner-product-name} into a new VPC (end-to-end deployment)*. This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys Redshift cluster into this new VPC.
* *Deploy {partner-product-name} into an existing VPC*. This option provisions Redshift cluster in your existing AWS infrastructure.

The Quick Start provides separate templates for these options. It also lets you configure Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks, instance types, and {partner-product-name} settings, as discussed later in this guide.
